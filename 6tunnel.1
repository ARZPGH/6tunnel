.SH DESCRIPTION
.B 6tunnel
allows you to use services provided by IPv6 hosts with IPv4-only
applications and vice-versa. It can bind to any of your IPv4 (default) or
IPv6 addresses and forward all data to IPv4 or IPv6 (default) host. For
example
.IP
.BI 6tunnel "\ " \-1 "\ " 6668 "\ " irc6.net "\ " 6667
.LP
will do, to connect to IPv6 irc server with
.IP
.BI irc "\ " foobar "\ " localhost:6668
.LP
This is a
.B simple
tunnel so there is no authorization and no logging. Unless you declare
.B \-1
option, everyone will be able to use your tunnel.

.B 6tunnel
can also be used as a tunnel for all other combinations of IPv4 and IPv6
endpoints. If remote host doesn't have any IPv6 addresses,
.B 6tunnel
IPv4 one will be used. In other cases, use
.B \-4
parameter which makes IPv4 address the preffered one. For IPv6 to * tunnels
use
.B \-6
which makes
.B 6tunnel
bind to IPv6 address.
